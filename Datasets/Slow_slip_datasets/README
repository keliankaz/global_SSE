    Note:
    Data aquired upon personal communications with the corresponding author, Mason Perry. The raw data can be found under Costa_Rica/osa_raw. Note that I removed a 2013 slow slip event that was only detected one GPS station as the source characteristics cannot be determined. Centroids are found by taking the weighted average (by slip magnitude) of the center point of the 4 fault patches with the largest slip. In one event (2022b) event this leads to a slightly odd position due to a bimodal slip distribution along strike. Tables with the modelled slip distributions (only rake-slip) with slab depth and slip in meters are included in the raw data.
